TestData
========

Some easily-manipulated test resource serves to help HTTP client developers
simulate various conditions, including error conditions, in a deterministic way.

Installing
==========

1. git clone
2. bin/make.sh
3. ensure public web folder is pointing at web/

Dynamic Feeds
=============

The root, e.g. http://testdata.player.fm will update every 10 seconds. Items are
consistent, ie when the latest item is relegated to 2nd place in 10 seconds,
it will retain its title, pubDate, and other properties.

Examples:

* http://testdata.player.fm/
* http://testdata.player.fm?interval=60 # posts change every 60 seconds
* http://testdata.player.fm?time=1391473816944 # time of latest post

File Serving
============

File serving example:

~220MB mp3 with no length info
> http://testdata.player.fm/file.php?name=human&type=audio/mpeg&length=false

~220MB mp3 with wrong length info
> http://testdata.player.fm/file.php?name=human&type=audio/mpeg&length=123456

~10MB mp3
> http://testdata.player.fm/file.php?name=meta&type=audio/mpeg&length=123456

~10MB mp3 with variable bitrate
> http://testdata.player.fm/file.php?name=metavbr&type=audio/mpeg&length=123456

~tiny mp3
> http://testdata.player.fm/file.php?name=freakowild&type=audio/mpeg&length=123456

Find more filenames and file types (ogg etc) in the git repo (see bin/media.sh script for now)

Arguments

* ID (default: freakowild) - mp3 filename (see git repo for options)
* length (default: true) - the response length header you want. "true" means guess actual length, "false" means no length or server's default.
* prepause (default: 0) - a delay before sending
* postpause (default: 0) - a delay after sending
* type (default: true - note this is broken in production now due to a pending Dreamhost issue) - the response content header you want. "true" means guess actual type, "false" means no type or server's default.
