			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How man people have read the entire bible, cover to cover? Well…. I have. A few times. And now I’m about to do it again. <a href="http://wpmu.thepodcastnetwork.com/cameronreadsthebible/2010/07/12/episode-1-genesis-11-119/">This time, however, I’m going to record it.</a> That’s right – the entire bible. Old and new testaments.</p>
<p>Why? Because it’s a fascinating, confusing, humorous and scary piece of literature. And everyone, Christian or not, should know what it says. Ninety-nine percent of all of the Christians I’ve ever asked have told me that they HAVE NOT read it cover to cover, even the people who actually think it is the literal word of GOD. Pretty amazing.</p>
<p>So anyway – now all of you lazy people don’t have to read it, because I’m going to do it for you. And I’ll even explain it as I go.</p>
<p>What will you learn from this episode?<br />
1. That God lied to Adam and Eve.<br />
2. That the Serpent told them the truth.<br />
3. That God seems to be pretty random with whom he punishes and why.<br />
4. That God seems pretty confused when it comes to maths (how many days did he send rain during the Great Flood?).<br />
And much, much more.</p>
<p>Even though I’m an atheist, I’m going to try my hardest to read the book seriously and without judgment. Which, I’ll admit, is pretty hard to do. That’s not to say that I won’t provide any commentary at all – after all, you can’t read this stuff without, at time, scratching your head and what is going on. But I’m not reading it as a skeptic. I’m reading it as someone who is genuinely fascinated by the book.<br />
Final disclaimer – I am *not* a biblical scholar. Although I have been interested in biblical history for most of my life, and I have interviewed quite a few biblical scholars on my No Illusions podcast, I am not a scholar and I am *not* treating this as a scholarly exercise. It’s a simple reading of the books, from start to finish, by a lay person.</p>

<p>You know that we spend a LOT of time producing our shows for you.</p>
<p>As we are NOT owned by a large corporation, or funded by venture capitalists, and we aren’t making a lot of money out of advertising, we’d like to ask for your support to help us keep TPN running. We have real costs in IT support, hardware, bandwidth, etc. </p>
<p>Now, we know that paying for online content is probably new to some of you. You are used to getting it for free.</p>
<p>However, we do ask you to think about the idea of the people funding their own media. We all know that if corporate advertising is the main source of funding for the media, it influences the kinds of media that is produced and the messages they carry. We don’t want that kind of media to be the only kind out there. We want an independent media, run by the people and for the people.</p>
<p>Please consider using the above widget to donate the cost of a CD or a book. If you&#8217;d like to make your donation come out of your account once a month automatically, then please visit <a href="http://tpn.thepodcastnetwork.com/pledge/">our subscription page</a>. </p>
<h3><strong>All we need is 500 listeners taking up the $20 a month subscription to secure our future!</strong></h3>
<p>Thanks for your continued support. </p>

<p>I&#8217;ve just been hit with a large hosting bill for TPN&#8217;s servers and bandwidth and unfortunately I don&#8217;t have the funds to cover it this month. So I have set up a special fund raising exercise via ChipIn which will run for this week. Out of TPN&#8217;s hundreds of thousands of listeners, I&#8217;m hoping a few hundred will be able to chip in $10 to help us stay on the air.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well we&#8217;ve got new drives installed and we&#8217;re going to be rebuilding the old sites from backups as fast as possible. Unfortunately, we recently outgrew the service we were using to backup the architecture and media files (we have over 500Gb of media files) and this crash happened before I managed to get a bigger backup drive configured. It&#8217;s always the way. As a result we&#8217;ve lost the old media files, so we&#8217;ll be getting the hosts to re-upload as many as possible. In addition, we&#8217;ll be providing an FTP drop box for the audience to send us any files they have that we don&#8217;t. And I&#8217;m also hoping we&#8217;ll be able to find a data forensic service that can pull stuff from our old dead drive. So I think we&#8217;ll be okay. It&#8217;ll probably take us a week to get all of the current shows back up and running. Thanks for all of the messages of support I&#8217;ve been getting via <a href="mailto:cameron@thepodcastnetwork.com">email</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/cameronreilly">twitter</a>.</p>
<p>As most of you know, TPN is a bootstrap operation. In an effort to build a genuinely new and independent media company, we haven&#8217;t taken any funding and I&#8217;ve been paying for it out of my own pocket for the last four years, with assistance from a little bit of advertising and your generous pledge donations. On the smell of an oily rag we&#8217;ve built a range of shows with an average of 400 &#8211; 500,000 listeners a month who download about 800,000 episodes each month (12 TERABYTES of out-bound traffic) and provide about 8 million page views. When you run a site with those stats on sticky-tape and chewing gum, sometimes stuff happens. Unfortunately this year we&#8217;ve had two major disasters &#8211; we were hacked back in March and now this hard drive failure.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m proud of what we&#8217;ve built with so little resources and I want to thank everyone for their continued support. We&#8217;ll be back shortly.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In our effort to create a variety of revenue streams to support indy media, TPN is providing links to a range of affiliate deals where you can shop as you normally would from some of the worldâ€™s top online stores. However, if you use these links, every time you buy something, TPN gets a small percentage of the sticker price.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear TPN listeners, viewers and friends,</p>
<p>You know that we spend a LOT of time producing our shows for you.</p>
<p>And as we aren&#8217;t making money out of advertising, we&#8217;d like to ask for your support to help us keep TPN running. We have real costs in IT support, hardware, bandwidth, etc., as well as our time and effort. For the last four years, we&#8217;ve covered these costs ourselves. Outside a small amount of advertising that we have run, the majority of TPN&#8217;s costs have been covered by our founder Cameron Reilly and the TPN hosts.</p>
<p>Now, we know that paying for online content is probably new to some of you. You are used to getting it for free.</p>
<p>However, we do ask you to think about the idea of the people funding their own media. We all know that if corporate advertising is the main source of funding for the media, it influences the kinds of media that is produced and the messages they carry. We don&#8217;t want that kind of media to be the only kind out there. We want an independent media, run by the people and for the people.</p>
<p>If you want to support our efforts to bring you intelligent and entertaining content, please consider one of our donation plans below:</p>
<p>We have five ways to support a TPN podcast:</p>
<ul>A once-off donation</ul>
<ul> $2 per month subscription</ul>
<ul> $10 per month subscription</ul>
<ul> $20 per month subscription</ul>
<ul> $50 per month subscription</ul>
<p>If you&#8217;re not familiar with Paypal, don&#8217;t worry &#8211; you can use any regular credit card.</p>
