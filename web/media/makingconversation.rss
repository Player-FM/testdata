    <description><![CDATA[<p>Autumn is out here doin&apos; the important work! She joins Jen to chat all about size inclusivity in the maker space.  We kick it off with the (not-surprisingly frustrating) history of sizing because if we want to change the world, we must know where we came from. Autumn tells us all about her passion project of sharing designers and patterns that are size-inclusive and yarn dyers that also support, and then she shares how designers can ensure they are inclusive. And in the year of our Beyonce 2023, if you are not size inclusive, we hope you might listen and consider! :)<br/><br/>Prefer to watch your podcasts? <a href='https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZURwTwrvooNT-JFA3jIRhkk17uEWlMYW&amp;si=Itbkj6D7k5WYmikw'>Watch on YouTube</a>! <br/><br/>Find us on the Making app: <br/>Autumn: @AutumnEden-Goodman<br/>Jen: @KnitPurl<br/><br/><a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RMlSNIH4p5uVthHvamFktIYzLC3XAjLJLCNO89JlCNk/edit?usp=sharing'><b>Size Inclusive Collective</b></a><br/>Support Autumn&apos;s Work: <a href='https://ko-fi.com/autumneden_goodman'>ko-fi</a>, <a href='https://patreon.com/SizeInclusiveCollective?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&amp;utm_source=copyLink&amp;utm_campaign=creatorshare_fan&amp;utm_content=join_link'>Patreon</a><br/><a href='https://ByAutumn.com'>ByAutumn.com<br/></a><br/>Designers Autumn recommends following to learn how to be more size-inclusive:<br/><a href='https://ysolda.com/'>Ysolda</a><br/><a href='https://indigodragonfly.ca/'>Indigodragonfly</a><br/><a href='https://www.victoriamarchantknits.com/'>Victoria Marchant</a><br/><br/>Medium Article: A Brief System of <a href='https://medium.com/sizolution/a-brief-history-of-sizing-systems-aee6bd066834#:~:text=And%20then%2C%20in%20the%201970s,size%2012%20became%20an%208.'>Sizing Systems</a><br/><br/></p><p>Music by <a href='https://despatches.bandcamp.com/'>Despatches</a>. 💖</p> <p>Download the Making app and join our amazing community of makers by visiting <a href='https://themakingapp.com'>themakingapp.com</a><br/><br/>If you&apos;d like to give a shout-out, have a question that you&apos;d like us to answer on the podcast, or are interested in sponsoring Making Conversation, email us at hq@makingco.com.<br/><br/>See you in the Making app!<br/>ps- We talk about our values a lot.

    <title>Live-ish @ Flock Fiber Festival - &quot;When did you become a maker?&quot; pt. 2</title>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>We&apos;re back with more super fun vendor meet &amp; greet sneak peeks from <a href='http://flockfiberfestival.com/'>Flock Fiber Festival</a>, featuring the best wifi that Seattle&apos;s Parks department has to offer. 🤣 <br/><br/>ICYMI-We sat down with some of the vendors and recorded interviews. The goal was to bring a little Flock to those who could not make it or wanted to know more about the vendors that brought all their artistic beauty to year one. <br/> <br/>Stay tuned for part 3!  Full meet &amp; greet videos coming to <a href='http://themakingapp.com'>the Making app</a> soon! <a href='https://youtu.be/wM4CB90s9Kw'>Watch this episode on YouTube.</a><br/><br/>1- Sarah of <a href='https://seachangefibers.com/'>Sea Change Fibers</a> - Sea Change Fibers began in October 2016 as The Dye Project in Portland, Oregon. Born of a desire to dye tonal colors on non-superwash bases, which were largely unavailable in the hand dyed yarn market at that time, our color palette and aesthetic developed quickly. We moved to a home near Monterey Bay in 2017 and have evolved into Sea Change Fibers, a new name for 2020 and beyond that reflects both our location and our commitment to social and environmental justice.<br/><br/>2- Sophie of<a href='https://botanicalyarn.com/'> Botanical Yarn</a> - Botanical Yarn is based in York, UK. Inspired by everything botanical, Sophie has created an exclusive colorway, sock set, mini skein set, and project bag exclusively for Flock Fiber Festival. Sophie is obsessed with PINK  so expect lots of shades of cerise! Sophie was very excited to be flying over to Seattle from the UK.</p><p>3- Bea of <a href='https://wooldreamersus.com/'>Wooldreamers</a> -  Wooldreamers is a yarn company based in Spain specializing in Spanish Merino wool with an aim to reestablish the cultivation of wool in Spain, the country of origin of Merino sheep. With a lineage tracing back to the middle ages, the Merino breed was once fiercely guarded for its superior wool—in fact, it was prohibited to take them out of the country! We are excited to grow our community of wool enthusiasts by bringing these incredible fibers to the world in the form of beautiful yarns and thoughtfully made woolen items.</p><p>4- Katlin of <a href='https://porterwoolco.com/'>Porter Wool Co.</a> - My goal is to provide crafters with wearable, classic and eclectic colors. I specifically love to dye tonals that are rich and saturated, are easy to pair with speckled/variegated skeins, and are also perfect as stand-alone colorways in a project!  I also love playing with color and texture in my hand-dyed fiber top for spinners, and my large 4oz art batts featuring farm wool from small U.S. farms.</p><p>5- Jenny of <a href='https://www.316dyestudio.com/'>316 Dye Studio</a> - A Wichita, KS native (area code 316), I first began experimenting with dyeing just as Wichita was losing its last LYS. What began as a fun side hustle to fulfill a need in the fiber community, has now grown into a full-time business. My colorways are inspired from nature to neons, and everything in between. </p><p>6- Aimée of <a href='https://www.labienaimee.com/'>La Bien Aimée</a> - Established in 2015, La Bien Aimée is an artisanal dye studio located in Paris, France.

I had a moment recently watching as the pandemic is starting to slip from our collective (short-term) memory and from our day-to-day lives — mask mandates are all but gone, popular restaurants and bars are full again, many of the once-pervasive visual cues of a global pandemic are disappearing — where I felt really lucky to have the friends I do, especially during the darkest moments of the lockdowns. Friends to share concerns with, friends to distract from the horror, friends to share art and music and poetry with, friends to talk with about the books we read together, friends to feel close to even as we FaceTimed from across the country or across the world.<br/>Anyways, yeah. Feeling really grateful to and lucky to know my chosen family.<br/><br/><b>Jen</b><br/>I am grateful for the opportunities that I have given myself to stop and celebrate wins. We move so quickly sometimes that it feels like we just have to go go go. Stop and give yourself a moment of cheer. Reflect back on how far you&apos;ve come, even if it feels hard to give yourself that space.

    <title>Ep. 111 Recognizing Our Impact and Finding Joy with Paula Pereira</title>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>I’m your host Ashley Yousling. Today I’m sitting down to talk with the most joyful and loving Paula Pereira. Paula is full of life and her delight is infectious as she tells us stories about her creative journey and the discoveries she’s made along the way. If you’ve followed Paula’s work, you’re likely familiar with her designs in various publications, including Making magazine, and the beautiful techniques, unique stitch patterns, and blended yarns she uses to create timeless knitwear pieces. Paula has spent her life exploring ways to grow and expand, stepping out in courage, and considering the impact we have as humans on each other in everything we do. This coming March Paula is one of instructors at <a href='https://makingzine.com/pages/ritual'>Ritual</a>, our first ever virtual retreat for makers.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m your host Ashley Yousling. Today I’m sitting down to talk with the most joyful and loving Paula Pereira. Paula is full of life and her delight is infectious as she tells us stories about her creative journey and the discoveries she’s made along the way. If you’ve followed Paula’s work, you’re likely familiar with her designs in various publications, including Making magazine, and the beautiful techniques, unique stitch patterns, and blended yarns she uses to create timeless knitwear pieces. Paula has spent her life exploring ways to grow and expand, stepping out in courage, and considering the impact we have as humans on each other in everything we do. This coming March Paula is one of instructors at <a href='https://makingzine.com/pages/ritual'>Ritual</a>, our first ever virtual retreat for makers.

    <title>Ep. 110 Feeding Our Imaginations with Yarrow Magdalena</title>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>I’m your host Ashley Yousling and this week I’m talking with the most amazing maker with the most soothing voice ever, Yarrow Magdalena. Yarrow is an incredible artist with a deep devotion to helping others find creative and personal wellbeing through art, reflection, community, and love of our own bodies and souls. We traverse many stories and topics, from personal creative practice, grief, the impact social media and technology has on our lives, and feeding our imaginations. </p><p>This month Yarrow is hosting a beautiful creative winter retreat. Join them and others for a five day creative retreat you can do from home, like an artist residency but without the travel and time away from your favorite mug, bed &amp; art supplies. Meet from December 29th to January 2nd every day to close out the year, create together and set meaningful intentions for 2023. <br/><br/></p><p><b>Come to as many sessions as you like, work on whatever project speaks to you and start the year in a magical &amp; creative way that will stay with you throughout 2023.<br/></b><br/></p><p>Expect journaling prompts, tarot spreads, guided meditations and other resources to sweeten your time together. You can come in your pajamas, have kids or pets in the background and stay off video if you like. For more information and to register, visit <a href='https://themakingapp.com'>themakingapp.com</a> or download the Making app and find “Creative Winter Retreat” under classes. We hope to see you there!<br/><br/></p><p>You can connect with Yarrow on the Making app @yarrowmagdalena, their website at <a href='https://www.yarrowmagdalena.com/'>yarrowmagdelana.com</a> and their podcast <a href='https://www.yarrowmagdalena.com/podcast/'>Creative Devotion</a> can be found wherever you listen to podcasts. <br/><br/></p><p>We believe that the simple act of making can transform your life and in turn change our world.

    <title>Ep. 109 Navigating Disconnection and Embracing Abundance with Françoise Danoy</title>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>I’m your host Ashley Yousling and today I’m talking with someone whom I’ve known for many years, all the way back to when I first began this podcast and she purchased some yarn from my little online shop. Françoise Danoy whom you may also know as Frenchie, is the creator behind Aroha Knits, Swatch Studio Circle, and other fun ventures like the Yarn Alchemist. But we don’t spend much time talking about knitting or making, and just like with every episode, we go where the conversation leads and sometimes that means we go deep, to vulnerable and tender parts of our lives and stories. I’m so grateful for Françoise’s openness, for sharing this part of her story, heritage and heart, and for her permission to share that with you. I hope you take a moment to really hear Françoise’s story and all the richness and beauty of it, while also gaining more insight through the lived experience she so graciously takes time to share with us. </p><p>You can connect with Françoise on the Making app and Instagram @arohaknits<br/><br/>We believe that the simple act of making can transform your life and in turn change our world.

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Today I’m talking with artist, maker, crafter, and designer Elīza Māra.

My conversation with Elīza is no exception, we cover a lot of ground and it may resonate with some and not others, all of which is ok.

    <title>Ep. 107 Reclaiming the Color Yellow with Aimée Gille</title>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>Today we get to hear the story of Aimée Gille the founder of La Bien Aimée. Aimée is a whole vibe, one that bubbles up and overflows in the form of joy, encouragement, all things soft, and of course the color yellow. Today we go to deep tender places, reflect on the effects of the pandemic, and explore exciting possibilities. I’m grateful for Aimée and all she brings to this community of ours and I hope you enjoy listening in on our conversation. </p><p>You can connect with Aimée on the Making app and Instagram @labienaimee<br/><br/>We believe that the simple act of making can transform your life and in turn change our world. This is why Making exists. It all starts with inspiration. We’re inspired by people, by places, by experiences—a beautiful photo, a soft wool, a kind heart. These are the things that motivate us to make.</p><p>Making is here to disrupt systems—systems of oppression, systems that only benefit certain groups of people, and systems that extract. We’re here to challenge the narrative of profit over people. We believe a company can be founded for the purpose of good and change the world for better, while also creating opportunity at scale. Makers are tired of the monoliths.

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Today we’re taking it back, specifically to November 2016 to one of my favorite past episodes of what was then, the Woolful podcast.

    <title>Ep. 105 Jumping Head First Into Small Business with Melissa Galbraith</title>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>Today I’m talking with embroidery designer and soon-to-be author Melissa Galbraith of McreativeJ. We’ve loved getting to know Melissa over the past year as she was an early maker on the Making app, joined many of our online gatherings, and has shared her love of embroidery and passion for teaching others. Next spring she’s releasing her first book, How to Embroider Texture and Pattern : 20 Designs That Celebrate Pattern, Color, and Pop-Up Stitching, so make sure to keep an eye out! I love Melissa’s down to earth approach not only to embroidery and crafting in general, but also when it comes to building a business. I think you’ll feel encouraged and inspired.

    <description><![CDATA[<p>We’re in the midst of a series here on the podcast where we get to know everyone on the Making team. If you haven’t already caught up on some of these more recent episode, I definitely recommend you do. Making is what it is because of a small and very special group of people, people that I feel incredibly lucky to work and experience life together with. Today I’m talking with someone I absolutely adore, Jen Joyce, our head of marketing. It’s likely you’ve seen and heard Jen as she is everywhere and does many things, including all of our TikTok and Instagram content. Jen has the biggest heart of anyone I know and that comes through in our conversation. Many times in our team meetings we all find ourselves in tears, with Jen leading the charge, she is a Cancer after all. I feel incredibly grateful that she “said yes” when I asked her to join the Making team and I’m thrilled you get to hear more of her story today. </p><p>You can connect with Jen on the Making app and Instagram @knitpurl </p><p>We believe that the simple act of making can transform your life and in turn change our world.

    <title>Ep. 103 Turning Shit Into Sugar with Adella Colvin</title>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>Today I’m talking with Adella Colvin the founder of LolaBean Yarn Co. When I was writing this intro I was trying to figure out how to capture who Adella is and her passion for all she does and wants to do, but that’s proven to be a bit difficult and those of you who know Adella can understand why. With an incredibly strong voice and spirit, Adella is on a mission to make the world a better place, whether that be for individuals, communities, aspiring business owners and makers, or her daughter Lola. Adella shares her story and takes us from the South, to Spanish Harlem, to Georgia, and on into the future. She is one of the funniest people I’ve had on the podcast, I left our call with my cheeks sore from laughing and smiling, and I hope you do too. </p><p>You can connect with Adella on the Making app and Instagram @lolabeanyarnco </p><p>We believe that the simple act of making can transform your life and in turn change our world. This is why Making exists. It all starts with inspiration. We’re inspired by people, by places, by experiences—a beautiful photo, a soft wool, a kind heart. These are the things that motivate us to make.</p><p>Making is here to disrupt systems—systems of oppression, systems that only benefit certain groups of people, and systems that extract. We’re here to challenge the narrative of profit over people. We believe a company can be founded for the purpose of good and change the world for better, while also creating opportunity at scale. Makers are tired of the monoliths. The few companies that comprise our only choices of how we connect, how we transact, and how we learn.</p><p>Makers are ready for a better alternative and that is what we are building.</p><p>Becoming a BRIGHT Collective member helps us accomplish this. Visit <a href='http://makingzine.com/'>makingzine.com</a> to learn more.</p><p>The biggest of thanks to everyone involved in this weeks episode. I hope you’ll join me each week as we talk and learn from more fascinating makers. For podcast notes and transcriptions, visit our blog at <a href='http://makingzine.com/'>makingzine.com</a>.

    <description><![CDATA[<p>I’m your host Ashley Yousling. I started this podcast back in 2014 in the laundry room/closet of my San Francisco studio apartment. At the time I was working full time leading product at tech companies and while fulfilling, I was looking for a way to connect with makers and creatives outside of my tech life. I’ve always loved stories and could easily sit for hours listening to others share their creative journey’s. That is where this podcast all began, a way to story tell, a way to come together and connect with others just like ourselves. The podcast aired regular weekly episodes for a few years until I became a mom of two. Still working in tech, I found it nearly impossible to keep up and the podcast went on hiatus. Over the past few years it’s been an intention to relaunch the podcast in a consistent weekly format, to bring back the stories and some fresh new content. So here we are, back and better than ever. We’ve made a lot of changes to Making over the past year and Carrie my co-founder and I thought it would be fun to sit down and share a bit more about these changes, our lives, and what’s to come.

    <title>Ep. 86 / COLOR – Making a discovery with Carrie Hoge &amp; Ashley Yousling</title>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>For the past few months we’ve been busy getting the new Making podcast off the ground. As many of you know, Carrie and I joined forces last October and the Woolful podcast is now known as the Making podcast.

    <description><![CDATA[  Sponsor: The Yarn Collective is a new fibre and design company focused on working with the best independent designers to bring you luxurious hand-dyed yarns in a range of inspiring colorways. The Yarn Collective has kicked off the launch with a trio of designers representing the best of modern knitwear design; Melanie Berg, Carol Feller and Bristol Ivy. Carol Feller’s line Bloomsbury DK, a 100% merino, comes in a range of 10 shades, selected by herself based on colors that work well together and enhance each other. “Each story also has neutral shades included which create links between all the colors.” She’s launched the line with 3 patterns; The Dango hat, Lignite Sweater and Russler Shawl, which were all designed to show how the colors were created to mesh together. Visit theyarncollective.com and follow along on Instagram @theyarncollective and make sure to visit loveknitting.com, where you can purchase all The Yarn Collective yarns.  Fiber folk: There are so many uses for wool outside of clothing and handcrafts, whether it be rugs, blankets, insulation…or my personal favorite, wool bedding.

    <description><![CDATA[Sponsor: Shibui Knits was born in 2007, in the basement of Darcy Cameron’s yarn store Knit Purl in Portland, Oregon. Faced with the limitations of yarn from big-brand companies, she started her own label, bringing yarn of the highest quality to small, independent stores like her own. Shibui Knits has since grown to represent timeless sophistication in local yarn stores worldwide. All of the Shibui yarns are designed to become unique, luxury fabrics in a coordinated palette made for mixing, at any gauge. Each pattern is tailored with thoughtful techniques, resulting in an intuitive knitting process and garments with optimal fit. Today, they continue to be grounded in the concept of simplicity well executed, with loving attention to detail. In March of this year Shibui launched the SS17 collection along with their newest yarn Lunar, a lace weight merino and silk blend.

    <description><![CDATA[Sponsor: Taproot Magazine, is a quarterly print magazine full of delightful stories and photos written by and for people living fuller and digging deeper. Each issue is created around a subtle theme, featuring amazing recipes, crafts, and tales, all with the intention of inspiring people who are interested in deepening their connections to their families, communities, and themselves as they strive to live locally and closer to the ground. The content in each issue consistently blows me away. It is fulfilling and inspiring. The most recent issue GROW features a collection of wonderful finds as we close out Spring and step in Summer.

    <description><![CDATA[Sponsor: The Sated Sheep opened in February of 2015 in Dripping Springs Texas by Allison Wilcox. After practicing as a clinical psychologist for 30 years, Allison began looking to do something different..to focus on being a part of and building community, which led her to open The Sated Sheep. Allison shares, “I really believe that you change the world one moment and one soul at a time, and that a big part of that is education. I spend a lot of time just talking with folks who come in about where the yarns come from, how they are made, what the story is behind the person/company who made them etc. That’s super important to me personally and I try, as much as I can, to have that reflected in the choices I make in the shop.” The Sated Sheep is passionate about making craft accessible to everyone and they’ve partnered with the local library to offer free classes twice a month. So if you’re in the Austin or Dripping Springs Texas area or just passing through, make sure to seek out The Sated Sheep.

    <description><![CDATA[Sponsor: Sunday Knits has quickly become one of my new favorite yarns to knit with. Started in 2008 by Carol Sunday, Sunday Knits is a collection of 4 merino and merino blend yarns and beautiful patterns designed by Carol. From the 100% extra-fine Australian merino to the French Angora, all their fibers are humanely sourced and then milled in Italy to Carol’s meticulous and caring specifications. Aside from this yarns obvious qualities, they’re a dream to knit with…so soft yet sturdy and the breadth of colors are beautiful and perfect for color work…I have yet to move beyond swatching, as there are so many great uses for this wholesome yarn. And if you enjoy knitting shawls, make sure to take a look at Carol’s latest patterns, Windfeather and Water Hyacinth, featuring lacework and texture…a little warmth and a lot of style makes these beautiful shawls a wardrobe staple, and an enjoyable knit in any of Sunday Knits’ yarns. You can also find kits for these designs on their website.

    <description><![CDATA[Sponsor: Making is a bi-annual handcrafts publication created by Carrie Bostick Hoge of Madder, that brings crafts people from different areas of focus to one publication. The act of making helps to connect us to the past, knowing that many craft skills were practiced daily out of necessity. We also connect to our present, as we stop to slow down and enjoy the work at hand, leaving behind the stress of our busy days. And, possibly at the heart of our creations, is the future. As the sweater we knit or the blanket we quilt becomes an heirloom for our family to use, enjoy, and pass down to the next generation. Circling back and tying us to the past. All these connections are equally important and help to bring meaning and value to the beauty and utility we make. Subscriptions just opened for 2017, with the Spring issue DOTS shipping in May, which includes a Q &amp; A piece with today’s guest Maura Ambrose and myself, and the Fall issue LINES shipping in October.

    <description><![CDATA[Sponsor: Designs by Romi came about serendipitously in 2005 when designer Romi Hill began creating a collection of simple and elegant shawl pins as a solution to her problem of the shawls she’d worked so hard on, not staying put. What started as a bespoke side project, soon turned into passion, leading to knitwear designs many of us have come to love. Romi’s style transcends the common wardrobe, appealing to both novice and seasoned knitters. Her most recent eBook from the 7 Small Shawls Series, Asymmetry is a celebration of lace, a brilliant collection incorporating lace patterns with some of our favorite yarns.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[Sponsor: Designs by Romi came about serendipitously in 2005 when designer Romi Hill began creating a collection of simple and elegant shawl pins as a solution to her problem of the shawls she’d worked so hard on, not staying put. What started as a bespoke side project, soon turned into passion, leading to knitwear designs many of us have come to love. Romi’s style transcends the common wardrobe, appealing to both novice and seasoned knitters. Her most recent eBook from the 7 Small Shawls Series, Asymmetry is a celebration of lace, a brilliant collection incorporating lace patterns with some of our favorite yarns. Make sure to check find this eBook on Ravelry. And on February 1st Romi will be releasing a new eBook subscription.

Wool &amp; Honey’s focus is on thoughtful companies who add their own stories to our little spot in the world–brands that highlight fibers that mirror the exquisite natural beauty of their area.

Taking nothing more than two sticks and a string, we create warmth and comfort, fabric to clothe and decorate our bodies.

Started in 2008 by Carol Sunday, Sunday Knits is a collection of 4 merino and merino blend yarns and beautiful patterns designed by Carol. 100% extra-fine Australian merino to the French Angora, all their fibers are humanely sourced and then milled in Italy to Carol’s meticulous and caring specifications.

And if you enjoy knitting vests, make sure to take a look at Carol’s latest pattern, the Nancy Vest, a little warmth and a lot of style makes this classic best a wardrobe staple, and an enjoyable knit, in any of Sunday Knits’ 3-ply yarns.

When we pick up our needles and cast-on the first stitch, we become part of something much bigger than the project at hand. Farmers, shearers, spinners and dyers are working hard not only to produce the yarn we love, but to preserve a way of life that is at real risk of being lost. Farm to Needle invites you to join a journey; to peek behind the scenes of some of our favorite producers and gain a deeper understanding of the people, places, and animals at work. Discover Aspen Hollow Farm, Green Mountain Spinnery, Imperial Stock Ranch, Thirteen Mile Farm, YOTH, Saco River Dye House, and Twirl through patterns by Dianna Walla, Tif Fussell, Veronika Jobe, Karen Templer, Andrea Rangel, Annie Rowden and myself.

    <description><![CDATA[Sponsor: Loop is London’s leading local yarn shop, created by Susan Cropper in 2005, with the intention to bring the joy of colour, texture and design to the local fibre community. The shop itself is a warm, friendly place…full of inspiration and charisma, and you can see the care Susan has taken to create an inviting environment where folks can find the yarns they love and learn from the masters of their crafts…including Juju Vail, Jane Lithgow, Stephen West, Helene Magnusson, and Melanie Berg to name just a few. This past Fall Loop celebrated their 10th anniversary, and to celebrate they released their newest book aptly named, ’10’…featuring twelve gorgeous patterns from designers Meghan Fernandes, Stephen West, Rachel Atkinson, Paulina Popiolek, Donna Higgins, Kristen Kapur, Ysolda Teague, Juju Vail, Tif Fussell, Claire Montgomerie and Pam Allen. I’m a big fan of Susan’s eye for composition, with each pattern being beautifully photographed and knit in a color dyed just for Loop. You can find the book at Loop, their shop online and at a handful of lovely local yarn shops and some great news, you can now find the e-book version of ’10’ on Ravelry.

    <description><![CDATA[Sponsor: Designs by Romi came about serendipitously in 2005 when designer Romi Hill began creating a collection of simple and elegant shawl pins as a solution to her problem of the shawls she’d worked so hard on, not staying put. What started as a bespoke side project, soon turned into passion, leading to knitwear designs many of us have come to love. Romi’s style transcends the common wardrobe, appealing to both novice and seasoned knitters. Her most recent book “New Lace Knitting: Designs for Wide Open Spaces” is a celebration of lace, a brilliant collection incorporating lace patterns with some of our favorite yarns…including The Fibre Company yarns. Make sure to check out New Lace Knitting on Ravelry or your local yarn shop. And this weekend if you find yourself at Stitches West, make sure to stop by and say hi to Romi in person who will be at the Verb for Keeping Warm booth #917,919 and 921, where they will be presenting a new mystery shawl kit which includes 2 skeins of A Verb for Keeping Warm naturally dyed yarn, a limited edition shawl pin by Romi and the first clue for the mystery shawl…all wrapped up in a special […]<p>Music by <a href='https://despatches.bandcamp.com/'>Despatches</a>. 💖</p> <p>Download the Making app and join our amazing community of makers by visiting <a href='https://themakingapp.com'>themakingapp.com</a><br/><br/>If you&apos;d like to give a shout-out, have a question that you&apos;d like us to answer on the podcast, or are interested in sponsoring Making Conversation, email us at hq@makingco.com.<br/><br/>See you in the Making app!<br/>ps- We talk about our values a lot.

    <description><![CDATA[Sponsor: Old Homestead Alpacas is a beautiful homestead built in the 1870’s, located in Walla Walla Washington and now owned and operated by Elaine Vandiver and her husband. They’re creating a wonderful and welcoming place, with visions to live off the land and share their goods with their local community and beyond, including their gorgeous alpaca fiber and yarn. But their dreams go much deeper, and their story even deeper still. Elaine is an Iraq War vet and her husband a soldier in the National Guard, and as members of the Farmer Veterans Coalition, they are hopeful that this year they will be able to partner with their local VA hospital to start a program to bring returning combat vets suffering from PTSD and other service related trauma to the farm, sharing with them the incredible opportunity and purpose a career in farming can bring…something they themselves have found to be positively life changing.

Each issue is created around a subtle theme, featuring amazing recipes, crafts, and tales, all with the intention of inspiring people who are interested in deepening their connections to their families, communities, and themselves as they strive to live locally and closer to the ground. The content in each issue consistently blows me away. It is fulfilling and inspiring. I was thrilled to find that the most recent issue Shelter had a yurt on the cover, being that we just finished building our own yurt. This morning I laid in bed after having spent our first night in the yurt, reading this issue and soaking up all it’s goodness…for the head, heart and hands.

    <description><![CDATA[Sponsor:  In 2013, Anna Dianich opened Tolt Yarn and Wool. a local yarn shop in the beautiful Pacific Northwest town of Carnation, Washington. A couple weeks back we celebrated Tolt’s second anniversary, with the release of a very special book, Farm to Needle: Stories of Wool. When we pick up our needles and cast-on the first stitch, we become part of something much bigger than the project at hand. Farmers, shearers, spinners and dyers are working hard not only to produce the yarn we love, but to preserve a way of life that is at real risk of being lost. Farm to Needle invites you to join a journey; to peek behind the scenes of some of our favorite producers and gain a deeper understanding of the people, places, and animals at work. Discover Aspen Hollow Farm, Green Mountain Spinnery, Imperial Stock Ranch, Thirteen Mile Farm, YOTH, Saco River Dye House, and Twirl through patterns by Dianna Walla, Tif Fussell, Veronika Jobe, Karen Templer, Andrea Rangel, Annie Rowden and myself. This book was beautifully captured by a hardworking team, lead by Anna and Kathy Cadigan.

    <description><![CDATA[Sponsor: Ewetopia is a local yarn shop in rural Viroqua, WI, carrying a beautiful selection of yarns and fibers, including their very own line of hand dyed yarns. One of my favorite things about Ewetopia is it’s generational foundation, the shop was started by Kathryn Ashley-Wright and later her mother Lisa Ashley joined her as partner in the business. Along with Kathryn’s grandmother Gloria and her daughters Stella and Mae…you’ll sometimes find all four generations busy around the shop…what a special thing to have. In addition to the Ewetopia shop and yarn brand, Kathryn and her family have a farm in southwestern Wisconsin where they grow certified organic hay and rotationally graze their flock of 50 ewes…comprised of Corriedale, Border Leicester and Merino crosses, which contribute to their Ewetopia yarn and fiber line. If you’re in the Viroqua area or just passing through, make sure to visit them in person. You can find a selection of Ewetopia yarns and fibers, and more info on the shop and farm online at ewetopiafibershop.com. And find them on Instagram @ewetopiayarn.

    <description><![CDATA[Sponsor: Loop is London’s leading local yarn shop, created by Susan Cropper in 2005, with the intention to bring the joy of colour, texture and design to the local fibre community. The shop itself is a warm, friendly place…full of inspiration and charisma, and you can see the care Susan has taken to create an inviting environment where folks can find the yarns they love and learn from the masters of their crafts…including Juju Vail, Jane Lithgow, Stephen West, Helene Magnusson, and Melanie Berg to name just a few. This Fall Loop celebrated their 10th anniversary, and to celebrate they released their newest book aptly named, ’10’…featuring twelve gorgeous patterns from designers Meghan Fernandes, Stephen West, Rachel Atkinson, Paulina Popiolek, Donna Higgins, Kristen Kapur, Ysolha Teague, Juju Vail, Tif Fussell, Claire Montgomerie and today’s guest, Pam Allen. I’m a big fan of Susan’s eye for composition, with each pattern being beautifully photographed and knit in a color dyed just for Loop. The Meandering Shawl by Stephen West is on my list to make this Winter. You can find the book at Loop, their shop online and at a handful of lovely local yarn shops.

    <description><![CDATA[  Sponsor: I wanted to thank one of our sponsors for this week’s episode, Fiber in the Boro, Middle Tennessee’s largest Fall fiber festival. This one day festival is taking place on Saturday October 24th, with free admission and parking at the Rutherford County Agri-Park right off I-24. This is a wonderful opportunity to discover a wide array of special yarns, fibers, and spinning, knitting and weaving tools from fiber folks both local and all over the Eastern United States. Between the food trucks, yarn bus, classes on saori weaving, spinning, needle felting, natural dyeing, and twining, it’s an event that should not be missed. You can find more info at fiberintheboro.com or follow the festival on Facebook, Ravelry and Instagram @fiberintheboro. Fiber folk: You can’t help but be mesmerized by the work of Allison Volek Shelton, founder of Shutters and Shuttles in Nashville, TN. The intricacies of the designs, the curated colors of the fiber she both dyes and weaves with…it’s a bit unbelievable. What’s even more intriguiging is hearing her journey of how she went from pursuing a life as a glass blower to herpetology to cupcakes and finally landing in the most serendipitous of callings…a textile weaver.

    <description><![CDATA[I’m very excited to share the twenty-fourth episode of the Woolful podcast. Today we get to meet a special woman, Hanahlie Beise who’s passion has led her to dive into the world of fiber, raising a herd of alpacas and creating her yarn, Hinterland. Sponsor: I wanted to thank one of our sponsors of this week’s episode, Tin Can Knits. Alexa and Emily have created several endearing collections of modern, clearly written patterns that feature accessories and garments each sized for babies, all the way up to 4XL. I really love their Road Trip and Max and Bodhi’s Wardrobe collections, and hope to make the Fly Away blanket this Fall. They’ll be releasing the final pattern of the Max and Bodhi’s Wardrobe collection on June 11th, so make sure to find this and their other collections on Ravelry and to keep up with all the going ons visit tincanknits.com. Fiber folk: I’ve had the pleasure of getting to know Hanahlie since before the podcast launched, when she reached out to share what she’s been up to, raising Alpacas in British Columbia and creating yarn from her fiber and fiber she sources from other North American farms.

    <description><![CDATA[I’m very excited to share the twenty-third episode of the Woolful podcast. Today we get to meet a special woman who’s multi-faceted interests and background have propelled her in some exciting directions, Dianna Walla of Paper Tiger.   Sponsor: This episode is sponsored by Tolt Yarn and Wool. In 2013, Anna Dianich opened Tolt Yarn and Wool. a local yarn shop in Carnation Washington. Most recently she launched an online shop, full of yarns each with their own story and each handpicked by Anna. You couldn’t ask for more soul when it comes to a yarn shop. Visit toltyarnandwool.com Fiber folk: I wish I had gotten to know Dianna before we moved from Seattle a couple years ago, because her passion and enthusiasm for cultural fiber knowledge, in particular the Norwegian fiber world is enthralling and at the very least, quite dreamy. Dianna has designed some of the most beautiful color work patterns and her dedication to the craft is inspiring. You can find Dianna at paper-tiger.net and on Instagram @cakeandvikings.

Sponsor: This episode is sponsored by Fancy Tiger Crafts, a beautiful yarn shop based out of Denver, Colorado, who recently launched their online shop, fancytigercrafts.com.

Her desire to encourage others is evident through her blog and the various other places you’ll find her, but her ambition and hunger to make and inspire is what initially attracted me to her work. You can hear the smile in her voice and the happiness she finds in creating. You can find Shannon at veryshannon.com and on Instagram @soveryshannon.

    <description><![CDATA[I’m very excited to share the twentieth episode of the Woolful podcast. Today we get to meet two special women, a mother and daughter team who have created a fiber farm and shop in Lancaster Pennsylvania, Jeri Robinson-Lawrence and Irina Lawrence. Sponsor: This episode is sponsored by Knitterly, a very special yarn shop created by Shelli Westcott, based in Petaluma California and online at shop.knitterly.net. I am always so amazed at the well curated selection of yarns, fibers and classes Shelli works so hard to provide all us fiber enthusiasts. Make sure to visit when in Petaluma and online at shop.knitterly.net Fiber folk: I first met Jeri when she emailed me last Fall before the podcast even began. I was intrigued by the heritage breed sheep she and her daughter were raising and their efforts in creating awareness about these wonderful breeds and their wool. Their passion around education and breed preservation is a great thing, but even more great than that is their dedication to doing what they do, in whatever capacity they can.

    <description><![CDATA[I’m very excited to share the eighteenth episode of the Woolful podcast. Today we get to meet and hear the journey of a fascinating weaver from the Pacific Northwest, Ashli Tyre. Sponsor: This episode is sponsored by Portfiber, a wonderful shop in Portland, Maine, specializing in one of a kind, hand-dyed fiber and yarn. Casey has curated an incredible collection of spinning fiber including yak, Chiri, Alpaca, Polwarth and hand-dyed blends. You can visit Portfiber in person when in Portland Maine or shop online at portfiber.com Fiber folk: I first came across Ashli’s work via Instagram awhile back when I was mesmerized by her weaving and one day my friend Kathy sent an email sharing a bit of Ashli’s special story, process and a photo she’d taken, thinking she’d be a beautiful addition to the podcast. I couldn’t agree more. Much of Ashli’s inspiration comes from a very special place, the Pacific Northwest and in particular, Mount Rainier. Her approach and dedication to process, from wool selection, to natural dyeing to spinning and weaving, is just incredible. You can find Ashli at ashlityre.wordpress.com and on Instagram @ashlidtyre.

Today we get to meet an incredibly inspiring sheep farmer and shepherdess from Tasmania, Nan Bray of White Gum Wool. Sponsor: This episode is sponsored by Yarn, a charming online and local yarn shop based in Eureka, California. Yarn was created by Sunni Schrivner who has a dedication for natural fibers and supporting local yarns.

Fiber folk: Nan Bray first came on my fiber radar when a listener sent me an email sharing a bit about what Nan was up to and encouraging me to reach out and learn more. I’m so glad I did.

    <description><![CDATA[I’m very excited to share the 9th episode of the Woolful podcast, I really am this excited every week, trust me ;). Today we get to meet two women whom I’ve come to greatly admire, each from opposite sides of the world. Both Karen Templer of Fringe Association and Felicia Semple of The Craft Sessions, focus on intentional making and creating a handmade wardrobe, and that doing so doesn’t take talent, but a willingness to learn.

Just as importantly it will keep your stash useful as you will be sure to have enough yarn to knit the projects you would like.  StashBot will soon be available for Android and is also available in print.  For more information head to www.knitbot.com/stashbot.

    <title>Episode 8: Ioana van Deurzen – Woolen heritage and legacy, Romanian sheep, purpose and Moeke Yarns</title>
    <description><![CDATA[I’m very excited to share the eighth episode of the Woolful podcast. Today’s episode is a little different. As I’ve gotten to know today’s guest, Ioana van Deurzen of Moeke Yarns, and spent time hearing her incredible fiber journey, how it shaped her childhood and ultimately her life as an adult, I felt this story deserved it’s own space…it’s own episode. Sponsor: This episode is sponsored by Tolt Yarn and Wool, my favorite yarn shop. In 2013, Anna Dianich opened Tolt Yarn and Wool. a local yarn shop in Carnation Washington. Most recently she launched an online shop, full of yarns each with their own story and each handpicked by Anna. You couldn’t ask for more soul when it comes to a yarn shop. Visit toltyarnandwool.com Fiber folk 1: Ioana van Deurzen is an amazing woman, as you’ll soon learn. A little over a year ago she embarked on a journey with her brother and parents to create the  yarn company Moeke Yarns, to bring something back to her community that had been lost and honor her grandmother, Elena. You can find Ioana at moeke-yarns.com and on Instagram @moekeyarns.         Giveaway: The winner of last week’s giveaway, is @kelseyleftwich.

StashBot will soon be available for Android and is also available in print.  For more information head to www.knitbot.com/stashbot. Fiber folk 1: Julia is a horticulturalist, experimenter and explorer of natural dyes, and purveyor of all things wool. Her knowledge of plants and natural dyeing was inspiring not only to continue natural dyeing, but around the foraging and identification of plants.

    <title>Episode 2: Jerome Sevilla &amp; Sarah Higgins – Design, Thrifting, Sashiko and Recycling Yarn</title>
    <description><![CDATA[I’m very excited to share the second episode of the Woolful podcast. Today we get to meet two amazing fiber enthusiasts, Jerome Sevilla of Grid Junky and Sarah Higgins of Sarah In Pursuit. Sponsor: This episode is sponsored by Tolt Yarn and Wool, my favorite yarn shop. In 2013, Anna Dianich opened Tolt Yarn and Wool. a local yarn shop in Carnation Washington. Most recently she launched an online shop, full of yarns each with their own story and each handpicked by Anna. You couldn’t ask for more soul when it comes to a yarn shop. Visit toltyarnandwool.com Fiber folk 1: Sarah is a designer, photographer, and blogger based on the Central Coast of California. You can find her at sarahinpursuit.com and on Instagram @sarah_inpursuit. It was a lot of fun to talk with Sarah about how her journey in fiber was born as a child through her Waldorf education and how it’s transpired over the years and evolved into a new adventure with Monarch Knitting. Man on the street: For this week’s “Man on the Street” I asked a couple fiber enthusiasts to answer the following question, “What is your favorite vintage or thrifted, fiber related find and what made […]<p>Music by <a href='https://despatches.bandcamp.com/'>Despatches</a>. 💖</p> <p>Download the Making app and join our amazing community of makers by visiting <a href='https://themakingapp.com'>themakingapp.com</a><br/><br/>If you&apos;d like to give a shout-out, have a question that you&apos;d like us to answer on the podcast, or are interested in sponsoring Making Conversation, email us at hq@makingco.com.<br/><br/>See you in the Making app!<br/>ps- We talk about our values a lot.

    <title>Episode 1: Jess Schriebstein &amp; Kylie Gusset – Fiber travel, Cormo origins and being fiber-conscious</title>
    <description><![CDATA[I’m really excited to share with you the very first Woolful podcast. Today we get to meet two very fiber passionate women, Jess Schriebstein of Witchin in the Kitchen and Kylie Gusset of Ton of Wool. Sponsor: Our very first episode is sponsored by Fringe Supply Co. In 2012, Karen Templer opened Fringe Supply Co. an online shop full of thoughtful tools for the sustainable and aesthetically mindful maker. From bento bags to rosewood needles, you’ll get lost in this carefully curated emporium. Visit fringesupplyco.com Fiber folk 1: Jess is a Baltimore based cook, artist, seasoned traveler, and lover of wool. You can find her at witcheninthekitchen.com and on Instagram @thekitchenwitch. I was incredibly inspired as she shared her fiber journey and her experience in Oaxaca, where she spent a week learning the fiber customs and culture of the Oaxaca people. We dive into how her time there influenced her cooking, color and fiber choices as well as how she began the knitting group at NPR.
