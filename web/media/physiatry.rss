                        <p><span style="color: rgb(14, 79, 144);">Abstract </span><br>
                        <strong>OBJECTIVES</strong>: Chronic lymphedema occurs frequently in breast cancer patients and is associated with&nbsp; significant morbidity and reduced quality of life (QOL). In this pilot study we: 1) addressed whether conducting a larger RCT of aqua lymphatic therapy (ALT) would be feasible and 2) estimated the extent to which ALT combined with home based exercise, compared to home based exercise alone would reduce arm disability<br>
                        in patients with breast cancer related lymphedema (BCRL).<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>DESIGN</strong>: Twenty five women with BCRL were randomized to either ALT in addition to a home land-based exercise program (ALT group) (n=13) or to a home land-based exercise program alone (control group) (n=12). Participants were evaluated prior to and following a 12-week intervention period comprised of weekly pool exercise sessions. Main outcome measures were arm volume, arm disability, pain and QOL.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>RESULTS</strong>: At follow-up, there was no statistical difference between the control and ALT groups in any of the outcomes, except for present pain intensity. At the end of study period, there was no change in the lymphedematous limb volume in either group. Grip strength was improved in both groups. Only the ALT group showed a statistical significant difference with a reduction in pain intensity score and arm disability.<br>
                        Furthermore, QOL significantly improved only in the ALT group.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>CONCLUSIONS</strong>: Conducting a larger RCT would be feasible. In comparison to the beginning of the intervention, participants in the ALT group showed significant beneficial changes after 12 weeks of treatment, while the control group did not improve. ALT did not make the lymphedema volume worse and therefore may serve as a safe alternative to land-based treatments for BCRL. </p>

After graduating with her masters in kinesiology in 2004, Ms. Letellier started working as a research assistant in breast cancer. This led her to discover the field of arm dysfunction, with a particular interest in lymphedema. She soon realized that there was a lack of awareness and therapists dealing with this issue. She the completed the training to become a lymphedema (Vodder) and aqualymphatic (Tidhar) therapist. In order to gain knowledge in both clinical and research fields, she is currently pursuing a doctoral degree in Rehabilitation Science at McGill University (supervisor: Dr. Nancy Mayo) looking at arm dysfunction after breast cancer. In addition, since 2008, she is in charge of the Kinesiology Clinic at the Cedars Breast Clinic, Royal Victoria Hospital (Montreal, Canada).<br>

                        <p><span style="color: rgb(14, 79, 144);">Abstract </span><br>
                        <strong>OBJECTIVE:</strong> This study examines the effect of preinjury depressive symptoms on outcomes 3 mos after complicated and uncomplicated cases of mild traumatic brain injury.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>DESIGN:</strong> Preinjury depressive symptoms, experienced in the 30 days before injury, as measured by retrospective self-report, were assessed within the first 2 wks after injury. The outcome measures assessed at 3 mos after injury included affective/behavioral, cognitive, and physical problems and health-related quality-of-life.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>RESULTS:</strong> There were 177 patients who completed both the baseline and 3-mo follow-up interviews. The sample was categorized by severity of depressive symptoms in the month before injury as normal, mild, or moderate-severe. Compared with those reporting no preinjury depressive symptoms, persons reporting moderate-severe depressive symptoms had significantly worse outcomes on the Affective and Behavioral and the Cognitive subscales of the Head Injury-Family Interview Problem Checklist and on the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey Mental Component Summary score. The group reporting mild preinjury depressive symptoms scored worse on a measure of cognitive symptoms compared with those with no preinjury depressive symptoms. There was no interaction between preinjury depressive symptoms and severity of the mild traumatic brain injury (complicated or uncomplicated) for any of the outcomes.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>CONCLUSION:</strong> Moderate to severe depressive symptoms in the month before injury seems to be a possible risk factor for poor affective/behavioral, cognitive, and mental health-related quality-of-life outcomes at 3 mos after mild traumatic brain injury. Clinicians and researchers should consider the impact of preinjury depression on the recovery process to provide at-risk patients adequate treatment soon after injury.&nbsp;were no differences in magnetic resonance imaging scores. Satisfaction was high; there were no adverse events.</p>

The patients who came to rehabilitation with a PU or myocutaneous flap exhibited a higher rate of developing yet another PU while in rehabilitation (30.2%) than those who came to rehabilitation without an existing PU or flap (6.9%).

Twenty-six adults (32 elbows) with chronic lateral epicondylosis for 3 mos or longer were randomized to ultrasound-guided PrT with dextrose solution, ultrasound-guided PrT with dextrose-morrhuate sodium solution, or watchful waiting ("wait and see"). The primary outcome was the Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (100 points) at 4, 8, and 16 wks (all groups) and at 32 wks (PrT groups).
